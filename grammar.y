// Bison fundamentally works by asking flex to get the next token, which it
// returns as an object of type "yystype".  But tokens could be of any
// arbitrary data type!  So we deal with that in Bison by defining a C union
// holding each of the types of tokens that Flex could return, and have Bison
// use that union instead of "int" for the definition of "yystype":
%union {
	int ival;
	float fval;
	char *sval;
}

// define the "terminal symbol" token types I'm going to use (in CAPS
// by convention), and associate each with a field of the union:
%token <ival> INT
%token <fval> FLOAT
%token <sval> STRING
